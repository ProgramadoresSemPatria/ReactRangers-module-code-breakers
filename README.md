## Introduction

This trailmap is designed for developers who want to build strong foundations in front-end development. Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to deepen your knowledge, this guide will help you understand the key areas that every front-end developer should master.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the core concepts, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of:

- **HTML**: The structure of web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Making web pages interactive.

### Recommended Setup

- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any editor of your choice.
- **Version Control**: Git for version control and GitHub for repository hosting.
- **Browser**: Google Chrome (with developer tools enabled).
  
Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed for managing project dependencies.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
